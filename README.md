**How I approached the problem statement:**

The first step was to understand the problem statement. The overall idea was to create something on the lines of twitter, where I had to create a profile for an user, they should able to tweet and and follow user who are in twitter and they can also search tweets based on the hash-tags finally they also able to see the tweets of the their following people. 

I decided to build a Schema to understand and fix the data models involved and also limit the number of revisits to this area, as from previous experiences, its a good idea to freeze schema early on.

First of all, I decided to build a Authentication. So, I planned how to do it and wrote some APIs and Mongo Queries.

**Features**:

* The person can edit their profile details whenever they need after the successful authentication. 
* User can able to tweet in their dashboard and they can also tweet using the hash-tags. 
* Users can able to see whom they are following and who are their followers.
* The home page consists of Six button. The users can able to delete their tweets there 
* User can able to search tweets based on the hash-tags 
* They can see the tweets[whom they follow] in the feed. 
* The user can also post what is happening in their surrounding.

**Future Scopes:**

1. Hooks should be used
2. Redux should be added
